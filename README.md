How to integrate?
=================

Speak is started by [Sugar](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar).

Speak is [packaged by Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/sugar-speak).  On Fedora systems;

```
dnf install sugar-speak
```

Speak is not packaged by Debian and Ubuntu distributions.  On Debian
and Ubuntu systems dependencies include `gstreamer1.0-espeak`,
`gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0`, and `gir1.2-gst-plugins-base-1.0`.

Branch master
=============

The `master` branch targets an environment with latest stable release
of [Sugar](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar), with dependencies on
latest stable release of Fedora and Debian distributions.

Branch not-gstreamer1
=====================

The `not-gstreamer1` branch is a backport of features and bug fixes
from the `master` branch for ongoing maintenance of the activity on
Fedora 18 systems which don't have well-functioning GStreamer 1
packages.

API Key Configuration
=====================

Speak-AI uses the `Sugar-AI <https://ai.sugarlabs.org/>`_ backend for
LLM-powered chatbot responses. An API key is required for this feature.

**Getting an API key:**

1. Visit https://ai.sugarlabs.org/oauth-login
2. Sign in with GitHub or Google.
3. Copy your API key from the dashboard.

**Setting the key in the activity:**

When you launch Speak-AI for the first time, a dialog will
automatically prompt you to enter your API key. To change it later,
click the **Set Sugar-AI API Key** button in the activity toolbar.

If no key is set, the activity will fall back to the on-device SLM
or AIML brain.
